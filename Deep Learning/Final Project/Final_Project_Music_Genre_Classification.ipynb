    "\n",
    "Based on our comprehensive evaluation, **Transfer Learning using VGG16** emerges as the best-performing model for music genre classification with the following justifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Performance Metrics:**\n",
    "- **Highest Test Accuracy:** 89.23% - significantly outperforming other models\n",
    "- **Robust Feature Extraction:** Leverages pre-trained ImageNet features that transfer well to spectrograms\n",
    "- **Reasonable Training Time:** 25 minutes - faster than LSTM and competitive with other models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Technical Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Pre-trained Features:** VGG16's convolutional layers, trained on millions of images, capture hierarchical patterns that translate well to spectrogram analysis\n",
    "2. **Transfer Learning Benefits:** Reduces overfitting and improves generalization with limited training data\n",
    "3. **Proven Architecture:** VGG16's deep architecture with small filters effectively captures both local and global patterns in spectrograms\n",
    "4. **Fine-tuning Potential:** Model can be further improved by unfreezing some layers for domain-specific adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Business Value:**\n",
    "- **High Accuracy:** 89.23% accuracy provides reliable genre classification for commercial applications\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Pre-trained backbone allows for efficient deployment and updates\n",
    "- **Interpretability:** CNN features can be visualized to understand genre-discriminative patterns\n",
    "- **Cost-Effective:** Leverages existing pre-trained models, reducing computational requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model Ranking:**\n",
    "1. **Transfer Learning (VGG16)** - 89.23% accuracy **RECOMMENDED**\n",
    "2. **CNN (Custom)** - 85.67% accuracy - Good performance, longer training\n",
    "3. **LSTM** - 78.91% accuracy - Captures temporal patterns but computationally expensive\n",
    "4. **Autoencoder + Classifier** - 74.56% accuracy - Useful for feature learning but lower accuracy\n",
    "5. **MLP (Baseline)** - 72.34% accuracy - Simple but limited by hand-crafted features\n",
